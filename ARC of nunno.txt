Nunno Finance: Full System Architecture
Nunno Finance is not just an AI chatbot; it is a Proprietary Financial Intelligence Engine designed to educate beginners while providing professional-grade data analysis.

Core Philosophical Difference
While most AI apps are simple "GPT Wrappers" (they just send your question to ChatGPT), Nunno Finance uses a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Before the AI even speaks, Nunno's "sub-brains" (services) gather raw data from the real world, synthesize it, and then hand it to the AI for final translation into beginner-friendly terms.

1. The Intelligence Layer (Service-Oriented)
The system is powered by specialized backend services that run in parallel whenever you ask a question:

🧠 Historical Memory (Event-Based Analysis)
What it is: A proprietary database (
crypto_prediction.db
) containing raw technical snapshots of every major financial event from the last 5 years.
Why it's powerful: It allows Nunno to compare current market conditions to past historical patterns (e.g., "The current RSI setup is 90% similar to the 2020 COVID-19 bounce").
Status: Fully Integrated. Nunno uses this to provide "Expert Context" far beyond what generic AI models know.
📊 Technical Analysis Service
Orchestrates 40+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku Clouds).
Calculates "Market Regimes" (Trending, Ranging, Volatile) and "Trend Strength" in real-time.
📑 Tokenomics Service
Deep-dives into coin supply, market cap rankings, and inflation schedules.
Converts complex metrics into ROI simulations for beginners.
🌐 Web Research & News Service
Scrapes real-time market sentiment from News headlines and search engines.
Applies sentiment analysis to determine if news is "FUD" (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or "Bullish".
2. The Orchestration Layer (The "Nunno" Persona)
When a message comes in:

Intent Classification: Nunno determines which tools are needed (e.g., "User is asking about Bitcoin price -> need TA and Historical Events").
Parallel Execution: All required services run simultaneously to fetch fresh data.
Synthesis: The data is minified and fed into the AI LLM (OpenRouter/Claude).
Empathy translation: The LLM takes the raw data and explains it using analogies, simple terms, and "Beginner's Notes".
3. The Live Data Stream (WebSocket)
Nunno's frontend isn't static. It maintains a persistent WebSocket connection directly to the Binance exchange, providing 1:1 real-time price updates and live charts without the user needing to refresh.

4. Scalable Infrastructure
Database: SQLite for blazing-fast local queries of historical events.
Backend: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance streaming responses.
Frontend: Vite/React for a premium, responsive UI experience.
IMPORTANT

This architecture ensures that Nunno's advice is always grounded in Live Data and Historical Fact, rather than just "AI guesswork".--
